				AT-HOME REFLECTION		Huy Lam (115705162)

1) In one or two sentences, explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?

The arrays are declared to hold 10 elements because that is the maximum number of value a user can input, so
the array needs to be big enough to contain each individual value.

2) In two or three sentences, explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?

The advantage of using matching array is that it allows a variable to have a set number of elements.
The disadvantage of using matching array is that it is not flexible, meaning the size of the array
is fixed, data will be ignored if it exceeds the size of the array.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why?

I would say that this portion of the workshop is hard, between just right and too hard.
I think the reason why it is hard for me is because I did not fully understand what an array is and
how to work with it. Due to that, I struggled to find the solution for this workshop; additionally,
I misread the last part of at_home instruction.
