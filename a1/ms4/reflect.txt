				Milestone 4 Reflection
Name: Huy Lam (114705162)

1) Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct,
Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

I think the reason why the assignment asked me to use a struct that contains other
structs is because it is important for me to know how to utilise struct in various
ways to accomplish tasks. Also, I think having interrelated structs stored within a
struct will improve my data organization and efficiency.

2) What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

The most difficult part for me was figuring out how to pull structs from struct Contact
to create functions. I think the scanf issue in milestone 2 would have been the hardest
for me but thanks to advice and tips from the professor, it wasn't as hard.

3) How long did it take you to complete Milestone4?

Milestone 4 took me under 2 hours since most of the functions were already completed
in milestone 2.
