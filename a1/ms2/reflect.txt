1. Can you think of a more efficient way to ask a user to add the required information
to each data field?

One of the way I think I can be more efficient is to create separate functions for user
informations. This will help make the main source code significantly more organised and 
easier to look and navigate.

2. Explain why a C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must be capable
of storing 26 characters.

A C string must be terminated with '\0'. If a string is intended for 25 characters,
the array must be able to hold 26 characters because an extra element is require
to hold the NULL value.
