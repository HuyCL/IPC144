						AT-HOME REFLECTION

	After completing my first workshop, I learned how to use the basic functions of Visual Studio to code, edit, and execute a C program.
The second outcome after the workshop is that I learned how to get access to a remote host using an SSH client. Lastly, I learned how to use SFTP 
client to transfer code file(s) between two servers, in my case, from my desktop to the host matrix.
