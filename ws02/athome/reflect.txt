				AT-HOME REFLECTION

1. The most important thing I learned in this workshop is how to properly utilize
each command and think logically to reach a solution and accomplish given task(s).

2. It is important to add 0.005 to GST owing because it prevents certain compiler
like matrix from truncating the value.

3. By doing casting operation, I was able to change double variable(s) to int and that
allowed me to use modulus operator on the variable to get a desire result.

4. I think I was required to use modulus operator in this workshop is because it is 
ESSENTIAL for me and anyone who codes to at least know how to PROPERLY use all the 
OPERATORS provided by the program, even if you feel like you won't be using it in the
future.
