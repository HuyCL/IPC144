1) Name all the iteration constructs.

The iteration constructs are while, do while, and for.

2) In two or three sentences, explain the difference between a "do while" and a "while"
loop?

The order for 'while' construct is condition > sequence > change and 'do while' is
sequence > change > condition. During a 'while' loop, the sequence will only execute 
when the condition is met. For the 'do while' construct, the sequence will execute at 
least once before considering the condition.

3) In two or three sentences, explain what is meant by the term conditional expression?

A conditional expression is a alternative path that contains a condition and two
operands. When the condition is true, the expression will analyze the first operand,
and when the condition is false, the express will take the second operand to analyze.
