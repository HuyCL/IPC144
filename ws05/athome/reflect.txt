1) In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays
when dealing with related data.

When dealing with related data, array of struct is more efficient because it can store multiple variables
under one name. It is also easier to write and implement.

When there are multiple source file, it is best to use header file. The header file allows you to compress
functions from different source file into a single file and define it.
