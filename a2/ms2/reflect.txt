1) In 3 or 4 sentences explain the term "function" and briefly discuss the need for
functions in any language?

A function is a block of code that is separate from the main code. Every function
is programmed to perform specific tasks. Functions are convenient and efficient because
it can be reused on different programs.

2) Briefly explain why you think the "helper" functions are in a different module and
why those functions were not included in the "contacts" module?

I think the reason is because it helps ease up the navigation process in "contacts" 
module. The functions were separated accordingly, primary and secondary. The secondary
functions help reducing the size of the primary function so when writing 
codes, there won't be chunks of code in the primary functions.
