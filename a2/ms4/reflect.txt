				A2MS4 Reflection

3) The two functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone helped reducing the size
of my functions significantly. The two functions makes my code for other functions less
complex and readable. Since my code is readable, I was able to easily navigate around
my code.

4) Through the second assignment, I have a much better understanding of how functions
works. When the instructor, Fardad, first introduced the class about functions, I was
completely lost and overwhelmed. But now, I learned how to pass structs and arrays to
functions and properly use them. Also, I was able to put some of the string.h functions
to use when doing my assignment. Overall, it was a struggle to complete the assignment
but it was a very good practice.
